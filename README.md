# Iris Flower Classification

Machine learning project to classify Iris flowers into three species based on their measurements.

## Project Description
This project uses the classic Iris dataset to build classification models that can predict Iris species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) based on sepal and petal measurements.

## Features
- Sepal length (cm)
- Sepal width (cm)
- Petal length (cm)
- Petal width (cm)
- Target: Species (setosa, versicolor, virginica)

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-flower-classification.git
cd iris-flower-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
